<h1>Green Door Tavern<a class="headerlink" href="#green-door-tavern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Today&#8217;s lunch was at Green Door Tavern, a local pub and restaurant. Like most other pubs, the decor consists of assorted signs, posters, and other antique objects stuck to every surface that&#8217;s not used to walk on, sit on, or eat off of.</p>
<p>There is a separate dining area closer to the street with large windows that let in a plenty of light.</p>
<p>Menu items are centered around sandiwches, salads, and burgers- pretty typical lunch fare in River North. We noted some interesting new Asian-style dishes like Lawrence Avenue Wings (Lawrence Avenue is a famous part of Chicago&#8217;s Korea town) and a bun with kimchi and watermelon.</p>
<p>I went with the <strong>Bootlegger Burger</strong>, your typical bacon, fried egg, etc. burger, but a bit bigger, at half a pound. I had mine cooked Medium and served with a side of crinkle cut fries.</p>
<div class="section" id="presentation-and-portions">
<h2>Presentation and Portions<a class="headerlink" href="#presentation-and-portions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First thing you notice is the branding on the top bun - <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GDT</span></code>, the initials of the Green Door Tavern. Since the bun shows signs of toasting on both sides, I would guess they use some sort of novelty toaster to get that design there. Or perhaps they heat up a special branding iron. Regardless, it&#8217;s a cool presentational touch (though it doesn&#8217;t affect the taste). There are a lot of fries. I couldn&#8217;t finish all of them. It costs $10 for the whole deal (fries + burger), but you can swap out the fries for another side, like brussel sprouts, for an additional $2.</p>

<h2>Flavor and Taste<a class="headerlink" href="#flavor-and-taste" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The burger was good, as most burgers are. I keep on telling myself that I should just eat burgers at home since I&#8217;m fully satisfied with my own creations, but whenever I go out, I still end up with a burger on my plate. I would have preferred more veggies on it though. It came with a small cup of &#8216;whiskey ketchup&#8217; to dip the fries in, but I didn&#8217;t like the taste and went for normal Heinz instead. I don&#8217;t like my fries super crispy or overcooked. About half of mine were cooked how I like them (Culver&#8217;s is my ideal) and the rest were a bit overcooked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="value">
<h2>Value<a class="headerlink" href="#value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This cost me $10 plus tax and tip. I&#8217;d estimate your total to come out to around $12.50. Is it worth it? Compared to order up restaurants like Portillo&#8217;s, no. But to be fair, I can&#8217;t think of many sitdown places here in River North that come out to any less than that, unless you&#8217;re having an appetizer for lunch. And I&#8217;m definitely not going to be bringing an electric griddle to work for the sake of cooking my own burger. So factoring in some good time spent with co-workers over some good food, I think it&#8217;s worth the money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparisons">
<h2>Comparisons<a class="headerlink" href="#comparisons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I would definitely rank this offering over the nearby Franklin Room&#8217;s burger. I believe that was around $16 which is far too much for the burger I got. I have yet to try the burgers at Brunch (the restaurant, not the meal), but I don&#8217;t plan to when their strong suit is brunch food.</p>
<p>My favorite burger and fries combo is still Culver&#8217;s. Portillo&#8217;s, Smash Burger, and Tom and Eddie&#8217;s all come close.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like Five Guys fries, but their burger is amazing, probably better than Culver&#8217;s.</p>
