.. tip:: Look directly into the camera. It may be tempting to look at the customer in when speaking, but the experience will be more beneficial for the customer, the more the agent looks directly into the camera.

-----------
Studio Tabs
-----------
The LE Studio includes several tabs along the top of the LE Studio window which help the agent find and share information and conduct administrative tasks.

Web Browser & Intranet
======================
These tabs are web browsers embedded inside the LE Studio. They function like any normal web browser.

To share content from the web browser, simply click on the share button that resembles a paper airplane.

The Survey Response tab is optionally enabled in the Live Expert Enterprise.

Similar to the Notifications Panel, this Studio Tab displays a table of all notifications received by the logged in agent for the current day.

Studio Workflow
---------------
Call Invitation
===============
The Expert Enterprise server is aware of the status and expertise of every agent logged into the system. When a customer requests an agent, the Expert Enterprise determines which agent is available and best qualified to address a customer’s interest.
The Studio presents a video call invitation form with information about the call including any Custom Session Fields (see the Enterprise User Guide) and plays a ring tone for the selected agent.

The agent may accept the invitation and start the video call by clicking the Answer button.

Declining an invitation sets the agent’s status to Unavailable and puts the customer in queue for another qualified agent.

Video Call Process
==================

.. tip:: Greet the customer with a smile. It’s just as important to greet the customer with a smile and friendly tone as it is when in a traditional retail service environment.

.. tip:: Speak Slowly & Clearly. In many cases, using the Live Expert system will be the first time customers have used video-chat technology for customer service. To help set the pace and tone for the video call, it is important for the agent to lead by example, speaking slowly and clearly. The customer will likely follow the lead, resulting in a positive experience for both participants.

Video Call Controls
===================
Share content, adjust volume, and restart or transfer calls easily.

Text Chat
=========
In certain cases, it is helpful to have the ability to send a text chat message to the LE Anywhere customer’s screen using the Text Chat tab. Type the message and click send. The message is presented to the customer.

Ending a Call
=============
Click the End Call button at the conclusion of a video call. A confirmation dialog is presented.

Once the call is ended the Call Notes tab is presented for the agent to complete documentation about the video call, including customer information (if required) and call reason and disposition.

After the Call Notes are completed, the agent is automatically set to Available status so they can receive video call invitations.
