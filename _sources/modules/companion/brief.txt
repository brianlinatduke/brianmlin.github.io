How It Works
------------
A general overview of how Live Expert Companion works with the existing kiosk application.

Live Expert Companion Software Installed on the Legacy Kiosk PC
===============================================================
A standard Windows software install.

Add a Contact Button to the Legacy Kiosk User Interface
=======================================================
Create a button image. Add it to the legacy kiosk user interface. Set the button action with a URL such as the following: 

::

  liveexpert:connect/<expertise_category>;
        <language_preference>;
         <x_position>;<y_position>;
        <x_width>;<y_width>

Where expertise_category represents the topic (product, category, etc.) the customer is interested in, language_preference represents a language such as English or Spanish and the ``*_position`` arguments represent where the Live Expert video window should appear and how big it should be.

Customer Touches the Contact an Agent Button
============================================
The Live Expert Companion software installed on the kiosk is set to handle the liveexpert:// URL. It accepts the arguments and connects to the Expert Enterprise server to find the best agent to match the skills (expertise category and language preference) in the request.

Live Expert Companion Window Pop Up
===================================
The Live Expert Companion window opens in response to the customer’s touch. It provides instant feedback to the customer as the agent request is being fulfilled, serves as the video window during the call and provides application messaging necessary for the customer such as agent status if an agent is not immediately available.

Live Expert In Call Capability
==============================
Once the call is established, the customer and the agent can see and hear each other. With Live Expert’s screen sharing feature, the agent has the ability to see the same kiosk UI the customer is using to assist the customer with product information, shopping questions, checkout issues, and etc. Live Expert can optionally open a content sharing window where the agent can push content to share with the customer such as product images, specifications, how-to videos, etc.

End Call
========
Upon conclusion of the service interaction, the agent ends the call and the Live Expert Companion window optionally offers a one response questionnaire for the customer, thanks the customer for using the service and then disappears from the kiosk user interface.
