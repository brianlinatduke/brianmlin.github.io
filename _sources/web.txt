Overview
--------
Live Expert Anywhere can be enabled through the use of our JavaScript application in the way that best suits your implementation. The most common installation uses the Live Expert Widget; you may also take advantage of the Direct Access API.

Live Expert Widget
==================
The Live Expert Widget is enabled and provided for your use by default. With the Widget, a Flash animation, image, or multi-button set is floated along the side of your website.

Direct Access API
=================
By requesting to disable the Widget and including an additional JavaScript file, you gain access to the platform’s application programming interface.

Customization
=============
Each implementation requires parameters to be defined, with additional options that provide flexibility for your use case. These are reviewed in detail in the sections “Configuration Parameters” and “Custom Session Fields”.
