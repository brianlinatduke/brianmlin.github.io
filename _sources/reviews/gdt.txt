Green Door Tavern
=================

Today's lunch was at Green Door Tavern, a local pub and restaurant. Like most other pubs, the decor consists of assorted signs, posters, and other antique objects stuck to every surface that's not used to walk on, sit on, or eat off of. 

There is a separate dining area closer to the street with large windows that let in a plenty of light. 

Menu items are centered around sandiwches, salads, and burgers- pretty typical lunch fare in River North. We noted some interesting new Asian-style dishes like Lawrence Avenue Wings (Lawrence Avenue is a famous part of Chicago's Korea town) and a bun with kimchi and watermelon. 

I went with the **Bootlegger Burger**, your typical bacon, fried egg, etc. burger, but a bit bigger, at half a pound. I had mine cooked Medium and served with a side of crinkle cut fries.

Presentation and Portions
-------------------------

First thing you notice is the branding on the top bun - ``GDT``, the initials of the Green Door Tavern. Since the bun shows signs of toasting on both sides, I would guess they use some sort of novelty toaster to get that design there. Or perhaps they heat up a special branding iron. Regardless, it's a cool presentational touch (though it doesn't affect the taste). There are a lot of fries. I couldn't finish all of them. It costs $10 for the whole deal (fries + burger), but you can swap out the fries for another side, like brussel sprouts, for an additional $2.

Flavor and Taste
----------------

The burger was good, as most burgers are. I keep on telling myself that I should just eat burgers at home since I'm fully satisfied with my own creations, but whenever I go out, I still end up with a burger on my plate. I would have preferred more veggies on it though. It came with a small cup of 'whiskey ketchup' to dip the fries in, but I didn't like the taste and went for normal Heinz instead. I don't like my fries super crispy or overcooked. About half of mine were cooked how I like them (Culver's is my ideal) and the rest were a bit overcooked.

Value

This cost me $10 plus tax and tip. I'd estimate your total to come out to around $12.50. Is it worth it? Compared to order up restaurants like Portillo's, no. But to be fair, I can't think of many sitdown places here in River North that come out to any less than that, unless you're having an appetizer for lunch. And I'm definitely not going to be bringing an electric griddle to work for the sake of cooking my own burger. So factoring in some good time spent with co-workers over some good food, I think it's worth the money.

Comparisons

I would definitely rank this offering over the nearby Franklin Room's burger. I believe that was around $16 which is far too much for the burger I got. I have yet to try the burgers at Brunch (the restaurant, not the meal), but I don't plan to when their strong suit is brunch food. 

My favorite burger and fries combo is still Culver's. Portillo's, Smash Burger, and Tom and Eddie's all come close. 

I don't like Five Guys fries, but their burger is amazing, probably better than Culver's.
