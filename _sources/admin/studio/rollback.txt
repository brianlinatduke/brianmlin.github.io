If it is necessary to roll back to a previous version of LE Studio, there are easy steps to get there. In order to perform a valid roll back, the correct LE Studio version number is needed. To find this number, follow the below steps:

**Step 1:**

Select the ``Live Expert Studio`` icon on your machine's desktop.

Now you will be at the below window: 

Note: This folder location is home to the latest/current version (in this case 5.7.42) and the last three previous LE Studio versions (5.6.8, 5.4.12, and 5.3.36) that have been deployed to your environment.

**Step 5:**

Now that the previous version numbers have been noted, we can roll back the LE Studio version number properly. In this case, as seen above, our current version is 5.7.42 and we want to go back to the 5.6.8 LE Studio.

Close the explorer window from Step 4.

**Step 6:**

Select ``LE Studio``; copy and paste it on the desktop. Now, right click ``LE Studio`` again and select ``Properties``.

**Step 7:**

The ``Properties Window`` will now launch.

Note: In the shortcut section, the target location is the current LE Studio version (5.7.42). We want to roll this back to 5.6.8. 

See the next step to accomplish this.

**Step 8:**

Put your cursor in the target text box, delete the current target (5.7.42 in this case), and add the version you wish to roll back to. In this case, 5.6.8 is what we are rolling back to.
